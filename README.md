# Accounting Application Documentation

The accounting application is a tool for determining the price of goods, calculating specific goods and items, creating orders for delivery, and providing all the information about the weight and dimensions of the packages.

# How to Use

## Using in Local Environment

First, you need to download the code to your local machine by clicking [Download ZIP](https://github.com/Bohdanvakh/accounting/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).

After you have installed the application, you need to open [cmd](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/cmd) to manage the code.

⚠️ The documentation describes the process of managing the application using a Windows machine. If you don't know how to use Windows and have switched to Linux, please check this [article](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/).

After you have opened cmd, go to the folder where the downloaded application is located by using the cd command. Example:
```bash
Windows\C:\Users\User> cd "/path/to/application"
```
